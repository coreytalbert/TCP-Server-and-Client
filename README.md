# TCP-Server-and-Client
Basic multithreaded TCP server and client in Python.

This project implements a simple Python HTTP server for TCP connections. The server incudes basic security functionality to prevent access to certain files and directories. The server responds to HTTP requests by responding with a standard HTTP header and, if appropriate, the requested file. The project includes a few HTML files and a directory simulating a basic website for testing purposes.

This implementation takes advantage of Pythons threading library to enable the server to handle multiple requests simultaneously. When a connection is accepted, the server creates a new thread. The thread runs a function that contains the logic to parse the response and respond appropriately, and always closes the connection before the end of the threadâ€™s lifetime. The implementation ensures that every request is handled before the server is shutdown by forcing the main thread to wait to join every running thread before exiting.
